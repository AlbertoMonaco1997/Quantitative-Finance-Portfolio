# Hi there, I'm Alberto Monaco ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Quantitative Analyst** based in Italy, currently working at Intesa Sanpaolo. With a Master's degree in Mathematics and a specialization in Finance, I am passionate about the intersection of mathematical rigor, financial markets, and technology.

My goal is to continuously deepen my expertise in **Asset, Portfolio, and Risk Management**. This GitHub profile serves as a living portfolio of my self-directed learning journey and the practical tools I build along the way.

## My Learning Philosophy

I believe the most effective way to master quantitative finance is by tackling real-world problems. My approach is not to follow tutorials, but to start with a practical question (e.g., *"Under what conditions is it better to take a loan against a portfolio versus liquidating assets?"*) and then build a robust, code-based solution from the ground up.

This **problem-driven methodology** ensures a deep, practical understanding of financial theory and its application. My focus is on building a library of reusable, efficient tools that solve tangible challenges in:

* **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** and Asset Allocation
* **Risk Management** (VaR, CVaR, stress-testing)
* **Financial Modeling** and Strategy Backtesting

## My Tech Stack & Toolkit

* **Languages:** Python, SQL, VBA, C
* **Core Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Plotly, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
* **Tools & Platforms:** Git, GitHub, Excel

## Featured Projects

Here are a few highlights from my portfolio. Each repository includes a detailed README explaining the methodology and results.
